## Overview

The Pneumonia Test System script allows users to go through a list of common symptoms associated with pneumonia and select the ones they are experiencing. Based on the selected symptoms, the system calculates a total percentage and provides a remark on the likelihood of having pneumonia.

The symptoms include:
- Chest Pain
- Fever
- Headache
- Cough
- Abdomen Pain

The system calculates a percentage score based on the symptoms selected, and the remark suggests whether there is a likelihood of having pneumonia or not.
